# SQL-database-manipulation

## <b> Goals </b>

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate different use cases of SQL queries and develop an understanding of how to use string functions, aggregate functions, ordering query results by a field, querying results based on value of a specific field, inner joins, grouping by a value, limiting query results, and using subqueries.

## Tools required
This project required using only MySQL. I used the [MySQL workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) available on the [MySQL Community Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/), but there are many other platforms on which this is possible, such as through cloud platforms (e.g. through [Cloud9](https://c9.io/new) by installing the MySQL interface with `mysql-ctl start`) or through one of the platforms on the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) website.
